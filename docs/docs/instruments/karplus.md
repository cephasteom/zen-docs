# Karplus Synth
`karplus` | `pluck`; implementation of the Karplus-Strong string synthesis technique. See [Pluck Synth](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.77/PluckSynth) in Tone.js. N.B. due to an audio worklet bug in [Tone](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/pull/1058), this doesn't currently work. 

## Parameters
In addition to the [generic methods](/docs/docs/instruments/), the Karplus Synth also accepts:
* `resonance` | `res`: Corresponds to duration of note.
* `dampening` | `damp`: Controls dampening of note using a lowpass filter.
