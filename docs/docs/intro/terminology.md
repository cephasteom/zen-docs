# Terminology
The following terminology is essential for a secure grounding in Zen:
* `Stream`: a sequence of points in geometrical space, and the synths that are created along its trajectory.
* `Event`: the creation of a synth.
* `Mutation`: the act of modulating, or morphing, all synths within a stream.
* `Parameters`: musical, synthesis, or effect attributes - such as frequency, modulation index or reverb time. These are mapped across each axis and determine the parameters of an event or mutation, depending on where it occurs in space.
* `Canvas`: a three-dimensional space used to visualise the movements of each stream.
