# Intro
In essence, Zen interprets 3D shapes as sound. With only the variable `t` (time) you can write simple, arithmetic expressions to define how an object moves around the x, y and z axes of a canvas. Multiple sound parameters can be mapped across each axis, with logical expression used to trigger morphing, sonic events across the canvas.

There's a bit of terminology to get you started - and plenty of advanced functions available for use further down the line. But, at its core, Zen enables you to compose complex, multidimensional musical patterns with short, simple code.
